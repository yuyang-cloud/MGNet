## Prerequisites

- PyTorch >= 1.1
- Python == 3.6
- gcc 5

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the github repository. We will call the cloned directory as `$DBG_ROOT`.  
```bash
cd $DBG_ROOT
```
Firstly, you should compile our proposal feature generation layers. 

Compile **pytorch-version** proposal feature generation layers:
```bash
cd pytorch/custom_op
python setup.py install
```

### Download Datasets

Prepare ActivityNet 1.3 dataset. You can use [official ActivityNet downloader](https://github.com/activitynet/ActivityNet/tree/master/Crawler) to download videos from the YouTube. Some videos have been deleted from YouTubeï¼Œand you can also ask for the whole dataset by email.

Extract visual feature, we adopt TSN model pretrained on the training set of ActivityNet, Please refer this repo [TSN-yjxiong](https://github.com/yjxiong/temporal-segment-networks) to extract frames and optical flow and refer this repo [anet2016-cuhk](https://github.com/yjxiong/anet2016-cuhk) to find pretrained TSN model.


For generating the video features, scripts in `./tools` will help you to start from scrach.

### Training
We provide training code of pytorch version. Please check the `feat_dir` in `config/config.yaml` and follow these steps to train your model: 
#### 1. Training
```bash
python pytorch/train.py config/config.yaml
```
#### 2. Testing
```bash
python pytorch/test.py config/config.yaml
```

#### 3. Postprocessing
```bash
python post_processing.py output/result/ results/result_proposals.json
```

#### 4. Evaluation
```bash
python eval.py results/result_proposals.json
```

### Testing
```bash
python pytorch/test.py config/config_pretrained.yaml
python post_processing.py output/result/ results/result_proposals.json
python eval.py results/result_proposals.json
```
